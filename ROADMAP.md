# Roadmap

The roadmap is an encapsulation of the features that we intend to build for ZenML. However, please note that we limited resources and therefore no means of guaranteeing that this roadmap will be followed precisely as described on this page. Rest assured we are working to follow this diligently - please keep us in check!

We intend for this to be a reflection of the _current_ thinking of what we and our users think are the most critical features to be prioritized and added to ZenML. If you do not agree with the prioritization, or see a feature here that you expect, please contact us at [support@zenml.io](mailto:support@zenml.io), or join the chat on our [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/) server. You can also start a thread at the[ GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/discussions).
