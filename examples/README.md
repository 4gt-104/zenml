## Examples

This `example` folder is dedicated to provide our users with some practical examples.

Here you can find a list with brief descriptions for each example:

- **cloud_gpu_training**: Training a classifier on a GPU with [Google Cloud AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform) as the training backend.
- **distributed_processing**: Showcases distributed preprocessing wth [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) as the processing backend.
- **gan**: Tutorial on how to create and train a GAN model with a custom `TrainerStep` and `PreprocessorStep`.
- **kubernetes_orchestrated**: Launches a kubernetes job on a kubernetes cluster.
- **pytorch**: Showcases PyTorch support.
- **quickstart**: The official quickstart tutorial.
- **vm_orchestrated**: Runs pipeline on an (optionally preemtible) virtual machine on `Google Cloud Platform` as the orchestration backend.

Note: A lot of the examples are based on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). Extensions to other cloud providers like AWS and Azure will 
be released over time, but the interactions will be very similar. In fact, adding support for these can a great first pull 
request if you would to be a contributor to ZenML!
