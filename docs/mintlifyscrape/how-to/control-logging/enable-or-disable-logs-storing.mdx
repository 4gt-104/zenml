title: "Enable or disable logs storage"
---

By default, ZenML uses a logging handler to capture the logs that occur during the execution of a step. Users are free to use the default python logging module or print statements, and ZenML's logging handler will catch these logs and store them.

Copy

```
import logging

from zenml import step

@step 

def my_step() -> None:

    logging.warning("`Hello`")  # You can use the regular `logging` module.

    print("World.")  # You can utilize `print` statements as well. 
```

These logs are stored within the respective artifact store of your stack. You can display the logs in the dashboard as follows:

![](/images/how-to/control-logging/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FSXceRPgF1t4PqY7HbePb%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-392577be3d3026770e0a4a4e92f8d30f7b2ce293%252Fzenml_step_logs.png)

Displaying step logs on the dashboard

Note that if you are not connected to a cloud artifact store with a service connector configured then you will not be able to view your logs in the dashboard. Read more [here](/how-to/control-logging/view-logs-on-the-dasbhoard).

If you do not want to store the logs in your artifact store, you can:

1. Disable it by using the `enable_step_logs` parameter either with your `@pipeline` or `@step` decorator:  
Copy  
```  
from zenml import pipeline, step  
@step(enable_step_logs=False)  # disables logging for this step  
def my_step() -> None:  
    ...  
@pipeline(enable_step_logs=False)  # disables logging for the entire pipeline  
def my_pipeline():  
    ...  
```
2. Disable it by using the environmental variable `ZENML_DISABLE_STEP_LOGS_STORAGE` and setting it to `true`. This environmental variable takes precedence over the parameters mentioned above. Note this environmental variable needs to be set on the [execution environment](/how-to/configure-python-environments#execution-environments), i.e., on the orchestrator level:

Copy

```
docker_settings = DockerSettings(environment={"ZENML_DISABLE_STEP_LOGS_STORAGE": "true"})

# Either add it to the decorator

@pipeline(settings={"docker": docker_settings})

def my_pipeline() -> None:

    my_step()

# Or configure the pipelines options

my_pipeline = my_pipeline.with_options(

    settings={"docker": docker_settings}

)
```
