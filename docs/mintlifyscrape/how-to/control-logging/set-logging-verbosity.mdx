By default, ZenML sets the logging verbosity to `INFO`. If you wish to change this, you can do so by setting the following environment variable:

Copy

```
export ZENML_LOGGING_VERBOSITY=INFO
```

Choose from `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `DEBUG`. This will set the logs to whichever level you suggest.

Note that setting this on the [client environment](/how-to/configure-python-environments#client-environment-or-the-runner-environment) (e.g. your local machine which runs the pipeline) will **not automatically set the same logging verbosity for remote pipeline runs**. That means setting this variable locally with only effect pipelines that run locally.

If you wish to control for [remote pipeline runs](/user-guide/production-guide/cloud-orchestration), you can set the `ZENML_LOGGING_VERBOSITY` environment variable in your pipeline runs environment as follows:

Copy

```
docker_settings = DockerSettings(environment={"ZENML_LOGGING_VERBOSITY": "DEBUG"})

# Either add it to the decorator

@pipeline(settings={"docker": docker_settings})

def my_pipeline() -> None:

    my_step()

# Or configure the pipelines options

my_pipeline = my_pipeline.with_options(

    settings={"docker": docker_settings}

)
```
