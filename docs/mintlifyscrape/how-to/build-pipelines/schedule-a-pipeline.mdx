Schedules don't work for all orchestrators. Here is a list of all supported orchestrators.

### Set a schedule

Copy

```
from zenml.config.schedule import Schedule

from zenml import pipeline

from datetime import datetime

@pipeline()

def my_pipeline(...):

    ...

# Use cron expressions

schedule = Schedule(cron_expression="5 14 * * 3")

# or alternatively use human-readable notations

schedule = Schedule(start_time=datetime.now(), interval_second=1800)

my_pipeline = my_pipeline.with_options(schedule=schedule)

my_pipeline()
```

Check out our [SDK docs](https://sdkdocs.zenml.io/latest/core%5Fcode%5Fdocs/core-config/#zenml.config.schedule.Schedule) to learn more about the different scheduling options.

### Pause/Stop a schedule

The way pipelines are scheduled depends on the orchestrator you are using. For example, if you are using Kubeflow, you can use the Kubeflow UI to stop or pause a scheduled run. However, the exact steps for stopping or pausing a scheduled run may vary depending on the orchestrator you are using. We recommend consulting the documentation for your orchestrator to learn the current method for stopping or pausing a scheduled run.

Note that ZenML only gets involved to schedule a run, but maintaining the lifecycle of the schedule (as explained above) is the responsibility of the user. If you run a pipeline containing a schedule two times, two scheduled pipelines (with different/unique names) will be created.
