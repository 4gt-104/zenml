description: "The best way to trigger a pipeline run so that it runs in the background"

By default your pipelines will run synchronously. This means your terminal will follow along the logs as the pipeline is being built/runs.

This behavior can be changed in multiple ways. Either the orchestrator can be configured to always run asynchronously by setting `synchronous=False`. The other option is to temporarily set this at the pipeline configuration level during runtime.

Copy

```
from zenml import pipeline

@pipeline(settings = {"orchestrator": {"synchronous": False}})

def my_pipeline():

  ...
```

or in a yaml config file:

Copy

```
settings:

  orchestrator.:

    synchronous: false
```
