description: "Trigger a pipeline using the ZenML Client."

This is a [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) only feature. Please [sign up here](https://cloud.zenml.io) get access. OSS users can only trigger a pipeline by calling the pipeline function inside their runner script.

Triggering a pipeline from the Python client **only** works if you've created at least one run template for that pipeline.

Copy

```
from zenml.client import Client

from zenml.config.pipeline_run_configuration import PipelineRunConfiguration

if __name__ == "__main__":

    run_config = PipelineRunConfiguration(steps={"trainer": {"parameters": {"data_artifact_id": data_artifact_id}}})

    Client().trigger_pipeline("training_pipeline", run_configuration=run_config)
```
