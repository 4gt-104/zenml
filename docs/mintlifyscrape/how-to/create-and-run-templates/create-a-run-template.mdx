This is a [ZenML Pro](https://zenml.io/pro) only feature. Please [sign up here](https://cloud.zenml.io) get access.

The creation of a run template from a pipeline run **only** works for runs that were executed on a remote stack (i.e. at least a remote orchestrator, artifact store, and container registry).

## Create a template in code

Copy

```
from zenml.client import Client

run = Client().get_pipeline_run()

Client().create_run_template(

    name=,

    deployment_id=run.deployment_id

)
```
