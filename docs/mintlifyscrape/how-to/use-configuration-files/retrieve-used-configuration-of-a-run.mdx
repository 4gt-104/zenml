title: "Find out which configuration was used for a run"
---

Sometimes you might want to extract the used configuration from a pipeline that has already run. You can do this simply by loading the pipeline run and accessing its `config` attribute.

Copy

```
from zenml.client import Client

pipeline_run = Client().get_pipeline_run("")

configuration = pipeline_run.config
```
