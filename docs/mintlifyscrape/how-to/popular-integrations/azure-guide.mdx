description: "A simple guide to create an Azure stack to run your ZenML pipelines"
---

This page aims to quickly set up a minimal production stack on Azure. With just a few simple steps, you will set up a resource group, a service principal with correct permissions and the relevant ZenML stack and components.

Would you like to skip ahead and deploy a full Azure ZenML cloud stack already?

Check out the [in-browser stack deployment wizard](/how-to/stack-deployment/deploy-a-cloud-stack), the [stack registration wizard](/how-to/stack-deployment/register-a-cloud-stack), or [the ZenML Azure Terraform module](/how-to/stack-deployment/deploy-a-cloud-stack-with-terraform) for a shortcut on how to deploy & register this stack.

To follow this guide, you need:

* An active Azure account.
* ZenML [installed](/getting-started/installation).
* ZenML `azure` integration installed with `zenml integration install azure`.

## 1\. Set up proper credentials

You can start by [creating a service principal by creating an app registration](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/manage-azureml-service/authentication-in-azureml/authentication-in-azureml.ipynb) on Azure:

1. Go to the App Registrations on the Azure portal.
2. Click on `+ New registration`,
3. Give it a name and click register.

Azure App Registrations

Once you create the service principal, you will get an Application ID and Tenant ID as they will be needed later.

Next, go to your service principal and click on the `Certificates & secrets` in the `Manage` menu. Here, you have to create a client secret. Note down the secret value as it will be needed later.

Azure App Registrations

## 2\. Create a service connector

Once you have created the service principal and the client secret, you can go ahead and create [a ZenML Azure Service Connector](/how-to/auth-management/azure-service-connector).

Copy

```
zenml service-connector register azure_connector --type azure \

  --auth-method service-principal \

  --client_secret= \

  --tenant_id= \

  --client_id=
```

You will use this service connector later on to connect your components with proper authentication.

## 3\. Create a resource group and the AzureML instance

Now, you have to [create a resource group on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal). To do this, go to the Azure portal and go to the `Resource Groups` page and click `+ Create`.

![](/images/how-to/popular-integrations/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FSXceRPgF1t4PqY7HbePb%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-4192ce97428cfa7f6f2c7c27d1d6458f044b9cda%252Fazure_4.png)

Azure Resource Groups

Once the resource group is created, go to the overview page of your new resource group and click `+ Create`. This will open up the marketplace where you can select a variety of resource to create. Look for `Azure Machine Learning`.

![](/images/how-to/popular-integrations/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FSXceRPgF1t4PqY7HbePb%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-35e217ceecb111bc7f6059f5c2d0166cb870b61b%252Fazure_5.png)

Azure Marketplace

Select it, and you will start the process of creating an AzureML workspace. As you can see from the `Workspace details`, AzureML workspaces come equipped with a storage account, key vault, and application insights. It is highly recommended that you create a container registry as well.

![](/images/how-to/popular-integrations/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FSXceRPgF1t4PqY7HbePb%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-6c1843e6feb8b5291c11aec65081afd0d0b95746%252Fazure_6.png)

AzureML Workspace Details

## 4\. Create Stack Components

In order to run any workflows on Azure using ZenML, you need an artifact store, an orchestrator and a container registry.

### Artifact Store (Azure Blob Storage)

For the artifact store, we will be using the storage account attached to our AzureML workspace. But before registering the component itself, you have to create a container for blob storage. To do this, go to the corresponding storage account in your workspace and create a new container:

![](/images/how-to/popular-integrations/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FSXceRPgF1t4PqY7HbePb%252Fuploads%252Fgit-blob-6a788efaa043e64462488a48b9f418f987e247d6%252Fazure_7.png)

Azure Blob Storage

Once you create the container, you can go ahead, register your artifact store using its path and connect it to your service connector:

Copy

```
zenml artifact-store register azure_artifact_store -f azure \

  --path= \ 

  --connector azure_connector
```

For more information regarding Azure Blob Storage artifact stores, feel free to [check the docs](/stack-components/artifact-stores/azure).

### Orchestrator (AzureML)

As for the orchestrator, no additional setup is needed. Simply use the following command to register it and connect it your service connector:

Copy

```
zenml orchestrator register azure_orchestrator -f azureml \

    --subscription_id= \

    --resource_group= \

    --workspace= \ 

    --connector azure_connector
```

For more information regarding AzureML orchestrator, feel free to [check the docs](/stack-components/orchestrators/azureml).

### Container Registry (Azure Container Registry)

Similar to the orchestrator, you can register and connect your container registry using the following command:

Copy

```
zenml container-registry register azure_container_registry -f azure \

  --uri= \ 

  --connector azure_connector
```

For more information regarding Azure container registries, feel free to [check the docs](/stack-components/container-registries/azure).

## 5\. Create a Stack

Now, you can use the registered components to create an Azure ZenML stack:

Copy

```
zenml stack register azure_stack \

    -o azure_orchestrator \

    -a azure_artifact_store \

    -c azure_container_registry \

    --set
```

## 6\. ...and you are done.

Just like that, you now have a fully working Azure stack ready to go. Feel free to take it for a spin by running a pipeline on it.

Define a ZenML pipeline:

Copy

```
from zenml import pipeline, step

@step

def hello_world() -> str:

    return "Hello from Azure!"

@pipeline

def azure_pipeline():

    hello_world()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    azure_pipeline()
```

Save this code to run.py and execute it. The pipeline will use Azure Blob Storage for artifact storage, AzureML for orchestration, and an Azure container registry.

Copy

```
python run.py
```

Now that you have a functional Azure stack set up with ZenML, you can explore more advanced features and capabilities offered by ZenML. Some next steps to consider:

* Dive deeper into ZenML's [production guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/release/0.66.0/docs/book/user-guide/production-guide/production-guide.md) to learn best practices for deploying and managing production-ready pipelines.
* Explore ZenML's [integrations](/stack-components/component-guide) with other popular tools and frameworks in the machine learning ecosystem.
* Join the [ZenML community](https://zenml.io/slack) to connect with other users, ask questions, and get support.
