# Introduction

**ZenML** is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for using production-ready Machine Learning pipelines, in a simple way. At its core, ZenML will orchestrate your experiment pipelines from **sourcing data** to **splitting, preprocessing, training**, all the way to the **evaluation of results** and even **serving**.

While there are other pipelining solutions for Machine Learning experiments, ZenML is focused on the following:

* Simplicity.
* Reproducibility. 
* Integrations.

## Why do I need ZenML?

**ZenML** solves the problem of getting Machine Learning in models. You should use **ZenML** if you struggle with:

* **Reproducing** training results in production.
* Managing ML **metadata**, including data, code, and model versioning.
* Getting \(and keeping\) ML models in **production**.
* **Reusing** code/data and reducing waste.
* Maintaining **comparability** between ML models.
* **Scaling ML** training/inference to large datasets.
* Retaining code **quality** alongside development velocity.
* Keeping up with the ML **tooling landscape** in a coherent manner.

## What do I do next?

If one of the above links are too hands-on, then a good place to go from this point is:

* Get up and running with your first pipeline [w](starter-guide/quickstart.md)ith our [starter guide](starter-guide/repository.md).
* Read more about [core concepts](core-concepts.md) to inform your decision about using **ZenML**.
* If you are familiar with the basics, jump right into the [advanced guide](advanced-guide/inspecting-all-pipelines.md) section.

## Get involved

If you're just not ready to use **ZenML** for whatever reason, but still would like to stay updated, then the best way is to [star the GitHub repository](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml)! You can then keep up with the latest going-on's of **ZenML**, and it would help us tremendously to get more people using it.

Contributions are also welcome! Please read out [contributing guide](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
