# Inspecting all pipelines in a repository

A pipeline defines a sequence of \(usually data\) processing steps. Pipelines consist of [Steps](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/tree/9c7429befb9a99f21f92d13deee005306bd06d66/docs/book/pipelines/steps/what-is-a-step.md) and each step is an independent entity that gets input and creates output. The output can potentially feed into other steps as inputs, and thatâ€™s how the order of execution is decided.

Every pipeline step produces `Artifacts` that are stored in the [Artifact Store](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/repository/artifact-store.html) and tracked by the [Metadata Store](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/repository/metadata-store.html) associated with the pipeline. These artifacts can be fetched directly or via helper methods. E.g. The `view_statistics()` and `view_schema()` are helper methods to easily view the artifacts from interim steps in a pipeline.

Every pipeline has an environment in which it executes, the so called `Orchestration` environment. This is defined by the [Orchestrator Backend](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/backends/orchestrator-backends.html). Read more in the [Backends docs](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/backends/what-is-a-backend.html).

### Types of pipelines

In ZenML, pipelines are higher-order abstractions for standard ML tasks. E.g. A [TrainingPipeline](../api-reference/zenml/zenml.pipelines.md#zenml-pipelines-package) is used to run a training experiment and deploy the resulting model. These pipelines can be used as base classes and extended to create specialized pipelines for your use-case. However, in many cases, the standard pipeline definitions can be used directly, and only the steps need to be manipulated. In general, you would only need to create your own Pipeline classes if you require a more flexible order of execution of the steps within the pipeline.

The mechanism to create a custom Pipeline will be published in more detail soon in this space. As a teaser, it will involve overriding the `BasePipeline` class. However, the details of this are currently being worked out and will be made available in future releases. For those of you brave enough to see the source-code, it should be simply done.

If you need this functionality earlier, then ping us on our [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite) or [create an issue on GitHub](https://https//github.com/maiot-io/zenml) so that we know about it!

### Relation to Tensorflow Extended \(TFX\) pipelines

A ZenML pipeline in the current version is a higher-level abstraction of an opinionated [TFX pipeline](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx). [ZenML Steps](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/tree/9c7429befb9a99f21f92d13deee005306bd06d66/docs/book/pipelines/steps/what-is-a-step.md) are in turn higher-level abstractions of TFX components.

To be clear, currently ZenML is an easier way of defining and running TFX pipelines. However, unlike TFX, ZenML treats pipelines as first-class citizens. We will elaborate more on the difference in this space, but for now if you are coming from writing your own TFX pipelines, our [quickstart](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/steps/quickstart.html) illustrates the difference well.

### Fetching pipelines

All pipelines within a ZenML repository are tracked centrally. In order to access information about your ZenML repository in code, you need to access the ZenML [Repository instance](../api-reference/zenml/zenml.repo.md#zenml-repo-package). This object is a Singleton and can be fetched any time from within your Python code simply by executing:

```python
from zenml.repo import Repository

# We recommend to add the type hint for auto-completion in your IDE/Notebook
repo: Repository = Repository.get_instance()
```

Now the `repo` object can be used to fetch all pipelines:

```python
# Get all pipelines
pipelines = repo.get_pipelines()  # returns a list of BasePipeline sub-classed objects
```

Depending on the type of the pipeline, you can then use its functions to inspect the pipeline, so for example to evaluate it or see its statistics.

If you are looking for a particular pipeline, there are more refined functions:

```python
# Get all names of pipelines
names = get_pipeline_names()

# Get pipeline by name
pipeline = get_pipeline_by_name(name='Experiment 1')

# Get pipeline by type (Each pipeline has a PIPELINE_TYPE defined as a string)
pipelines = get_pipelines_by_type(type_filter=['training'])

# Get pipeline by datasource
datasources = repo.get_datasources()
pipelines = repo.get_pipelines_by_datasource(datasources[0])
```

Using these commands, one can always look back at what pipelines have been registered and run in this repository.

It is important to note that most of the methods listed above involve parsing the [config YAML files](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/pipelines/what-is-a-pipeline.html) in your [Pipelines Directory](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/repository/pipeline-directory.html). Therefore, by changing the pipelines directory or manipulating it, you may lose a lot of valuable information regarding how the repository developed over time.

### Pipeline Properties

Each pipeline has an associated [metadata store](../core-concepts.md#metadata-store), [artifact store](../core-concepts.md#artifact-store) and `step_config`. The `step_config` is a dict that defines which [steps](../core-concepts.md#steps) are running in the pipeline.

In order to see the status of a pipeline:

```python
pipeline.get_status()
```

This queries the associated `metadata_store`, and returns either `NotStarted`, `Suceeded` , `Running` or `Failed` depending on the status of the pipeline.

Apart from the status, pipelines can have additional properties and helper functions that one can use to inspect it closely. For example, a `TrainingPipeline` has the `get_hyperparameters()` method to return the hyper-parameters used in the preprocesser and trainer steps.

Regardless of type, a ZenML pipeline is represented by a declarative config written in YAML. A sample config looks like this:

```yaml

```

The config above can be split into 5 distinct keys:

* `version`: The version of the YAML standard to maintain backwards compatibility.
* `artifact_store`: The path where the artifacts produced by the pipelines are stored.
* `backend`: The orchestrator [backend](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/backends/what-is-a-backend.html) for the pipeline.
* `metadata`: The metadata store config to store information of pipeline runs.
* `pipeline`: A global key that contains information regarding the pipeline run itself:
  * `source`: Path to pipeline code source code.
  * `args`: Individual args of the pipeline like `name` etc.
  * `datasource`: Details of the [datasource](http://docs.zenml.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/datasources/what-is-a-datasource.html) used in the pipeline.
  * `steps:`: Details of each [step](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/tree/9c7429befb9a99f21f92d13deee005306bd06d66/docs/book/pipelines/steps/what-is-a-step.md) used in the pipeline.

### Manipulating a pipeline after it has been run

After pipelines are run, they are marked as being `immutable`. This means that the internal [Steps](https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml/tree/9c7429befb9a99f21f92d13deee005306bd06d66/docs/book/pipelines/steps/what-is-a-step.md) of these pipelines can no longer be changed. However, a common pattern in Machine Learning is to re-use logical components across the entire lifecycle. And that is after all, the whole purpose of creating steps in the first place.

In order to re-use logic from another pipeline in ZenML, it is as simple as to execute:

```python
from zenml.repo.repo import Repository

# Get a reference in code to the current repo
repo = Repository()
pipeline_a = repo.get_pipeline_by_name('Pipeline A')

# Make a copy with a unique name
pipeline_b = pipeline_a.copy(new_name='Pipeline B')

# Change steps, metadata store, artifact store, backends etc freely.
```

Ensuring that run pipelines are immutable is crucial to maintain reproducibility in the ZenML design. Using the `copy()` paradigm allows the freedom of re-using steps with ease, and keeps reproducibility intact.

### Caching

The `copy()` paradigm also helps in _re-usability_ of code across pipelines. E.g. If now only the TrainerStep is changed in `pipeline_b` above, then the corresponding `pipeline_b` pipeline run will skip splitting, preprocessing and re-use all the artifacts already produced by `pipeline_a`.
