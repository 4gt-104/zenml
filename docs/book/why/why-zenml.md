# Why ZenML?

## Pipelines as ML experiments

## Development Experience



## The right abstractions

* Why we think this is the right abstraction layer \(have to compare with others\)

Too complicated:

* Dagster
* Flyte
* Metaflow
* Prefect

Too little ops:

* MLFlow
* Kedro

## The modular MLOps stack \(Integrations\)

Integrating with others.
