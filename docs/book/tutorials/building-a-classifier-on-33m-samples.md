# Classification with 59M samples \[WIP\]

In this tutorial, we'll go through the step-by-step process of building a simple feedforward classifier trained on a public BigQuery datasource. Structurally, the tutorial closely follows the quickstart, however, as we are handling a significantly larger dataset, we will have a more in-depth look into various aspects.
