# Ensuring ML reproducibility with ZenML
Reproducibility is a key aspect of putting Machine Learning in production, and therefore a key apsect 
of the ZenML framework. 

```{hint}
If working in a team, you might consider setting up a [collaborative environment](../repository/team-collaboration-with-zenml.md)  
to share reproducibility across your team.
```

Throughout development, ZenML has mechanisms in place that automatically ensure reproducibility in the following aspects:

* Code
* Configuration
* Environment
* Data
