### How do I create steps that create other steps AKA dynamic pipelines and steps?

Please read our general information on how to compose steps + pipelines together to start with. You might also find the code examples in our guide to implementing hyperparameter tuning which is related to this topic.

### How do I use templates: using starter code with ZenML

Project templates allow you to get going quickly with ZenML. We recommend the Starter template (starter) for most use cases which gives you a basic scaffold and structure around which you can write your own code. You can also build templates for others inside a Git repository and use them with ZenML's templates functionality.
